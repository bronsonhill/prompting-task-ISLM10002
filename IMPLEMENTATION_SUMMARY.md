# Dynamic Admin Page Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented dynamic admin page visibility based on user roles. The admin page now only appears in the sidebar for admin users, while regular users cannot see it.

## Changes Made

### 1. Migration to `st.navigation`
- **Before**: Used the old `pages/` directory structure which automatically showed all pages in the sidebar
- **After**: Migrated to Streamlit's new `st.navigation` system for dynamic, role-based navigation

### 2. File Structure Changes
```
Old Structure:
├── pages/
│   ├── 1_Chat.py
│   ├── 2_Prompt.py
│   └── 3_Admin.py

New Structure:
├── page_modules/
│   ├── chat.py
│   ├── prompt.py
│   └── admin.py
```

### 3. Key Implementation Details

#### Dynamic Navigation Logic
- **Regular Users**: See "Account" (Home, Logout) and "Main" (Chat, Prompts) sections
- **Admin Users**: See "Account", "Main", AND "Administration" (Admin) sections

#### Code Changes
1. **Home.py**: Complete rewrite to use `st.navigation` with role-based page assignment
2. **Requirements**: Updated to `streamlit>=1.36.0` for `st.navigation` support
3. **Page References**: Updated all internal page references to use new `page_modules/` paths

### 4. How It Works

#### Authentication Flow
1. User logs in with their access code
2. System checks if user is admin via `get_current_user_admin_status()`
3. Navigation menu is built dynamically based on admin status

#### Navigation Structure
```python
# For regular users:
page_dict = {
    "Account": [home, logout],
    "Main": [chat, prompt]
}

# For admin users:
page_dict = {
    "Account": [home, logout],
    "Main": [chat, prompt],
    "Administration": [admin]  # Only added for admins
}
```

## Testing Instructions

### For Regular Users:
1. Run: `streamlit run Home.py`
2. Login with a regular user code
3. Verify sidebar shows only:
   - **Account**: Home, Logout
   - **Main**: Chat, Prompts
4. Admin page should NOT be visible

### For Admin Users:
1. Run: `streamlit run Home.py`
2. Login with an admin user code
3. Verify sidebar shows:
   - **Account**: Home, Logout
   - **Main**: Chat, Prompts
   - **Administration**: Admin
4. Admin page should be visible and accessible

## Benefits

1. **Security**: Admin functionality is completely hidden from regular users
2. **Clean UI**: Regular users see only relevant navigation options
3. **Scalable**: Easy to add more role-based pages in the future
4. **Modern**: Uses Streamlit's latest navigation system

## Technical Notes

- The admin page still has server-side access controls as a security backup
- Navigation is determined at runtime based on current user's admin status
- All existing functionality is preserved while adding role-based navigation
- The change is backward compatible with existing user data and admin codes

## Files Modified

1. `Home.py` - Complete rewrite for dynamic navigation
2. `requirements.txt` - Updated Streamlit version requirement
3. `page_modules/chat.py` - Updated navigation references
4. `page_modules/prompt.py` - Updated navigation references
5. `page_modules/admin.py` - Updated navigation references, added null checks

## Status
✅ **Implementation Complete** - Admin page now dynamically appears based on user role.
